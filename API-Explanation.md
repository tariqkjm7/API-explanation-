# API TYPES 


* **REST:** The Representational State Transfer (REST) ​​architecture is probably the most popular way to build APIs. REST is based on a client/server approach that separates the front and back ends of the API, and provides great flexibility in development and implementation. REST is "stateless", which means that the API does not store any data or state between requests. REST supports caching, which stores responses to slow or time-insensitive APIs. REST APIs, commonly called "RESTful APIs", can also communicate directly or work through intermediary systems such as API portals and load balancers.


* **SOAP:** Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) could be a messaging standard defined by the globe Wide Web Consortium and is widely wont to create Web APIs, usually using XML. SOAP supports a large range of communication protocols found over the web like HTTP, SMTP, and TCP. SOAP is additionally extensible and pattern independent, allowing developers to put in writing SOAP APIs during a sort of ways and simply add features and functionality. The SOAP policy defines how a SOAP message is handled, features, built-in modules, communication protocol(s), and syntax for SOAP messages.



## the differences betweeb REST and SOAP

REST | SOAP 
----------- | ------------
**Works with XML, JSON, HTTP and plain text**|**Works with XML by design**
**Loose and flexible guidelines based on architectures** |**Strict, clearly-defined rules**
**Modest security** | **Advanced security**
**Works well with data** | **Works well with processes (actions)**
**Uses low bandwidth and is highly scalable** | **Uses more bandwidth with limited scalability**
 



 ### Why choose REST?

 * **Due to its scalability**. This protocol stands out because of its scalability. Thanks to the separation between client and server, the product may be expanded by the development team without much difficulty

 * **Due to its flexibility** and portability. With the indispensable requirement to correctly send data from one in all requests, it is possible to perform a migration from one server to another server or make changes to the database at any time. So the front end and back end can be hosted on different servers, which can be a big administrative advantage.

 * **Due to its independence** Due to the separation between client and server, the protocol makes it easy for developments across the numerous areas of a project to need place independently. additionally, the rest API adapts the smallest amount bit times to the working syntax and platform. This offers the possibility to try and do several environments while developing. 

 ### advantages of REST 

 * It is usually simple to build and adapt. 
 * Low use of resources.
 * Process instances are created explicitly.
 * With the initial URI, the client does not require routing information.
 * Clients can have a generic ‘listener’ interface for notifications.


 ### Advantages of SOAP:

  * Language, platform, and transport independent (REST requires use of HTTP)
  * Works well in distributed enterprise environments (REST assumes direct point-to-point communication)
  * Standardized
  * Provides significant pre-build extensibility in the form of the WS* standards
  * Built-in error handling
  * Automation when used with certain language products


### What’s the difference between an SDK and an API?


 There is no simple answer to how SDK and API differ since SDKs usually have an API. When the developer uses the SDK to build systems and develop applications, these applications need to communicate with other applications. The SDK includes an API to make this connection possible. On the other hand, while the API can be used for communication, it cannot create a completely new application. **`The real difference is that an API is really just an interface to a service, while an SDK is the tools/components/parts of code that are built for a specific purpose`**.
